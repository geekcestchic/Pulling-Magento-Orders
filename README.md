####Â Instructions
* Install Node and NPM
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run start`
* Open your browser at localhost:3000
* The app should run!

**Note**: If Chrome throws a X-Domain error, close chrome and type this in your console "open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir"
Warning, this will allow for X-domain access, so ensure you don't have too many random tabs open while testing the app
